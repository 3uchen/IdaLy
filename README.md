# IdaLy
IdaLy provides a python library and a software that support various algorithms for industrial data augmentation, which can promote the effiency of your industrial machine learning projects(such as fault diagnosis and soft sensor).You can use any algorithms in your script files by importing the python library.Certainly, if you are not familiar with coding of python or just want to finish augmentation tasks conveniently, you can use our software directly.  
## Augmentations
Because of the sampling difficulty and data privacy of industrial data, data we can acquire sometimes is insufficient, thus causing problems such as overfitting and class-imblance often occur while training intelligent agencies. Nowadays, more and more data augmentation algorithms are applied in the field of industrial big data. We collect some algorithms often used and classify them as follows:  
- **Noise Injection**
  - GNI:  Gaussian Nosie Injection
- **Interpolation**
